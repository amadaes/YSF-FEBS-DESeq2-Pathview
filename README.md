R scripts used for:
- generating and visualizing differential expression analysis results for RNA-seq data using DESeq2 starting from a raw counts matrix obtained using featureCounts
- cleaning up and rescaling differentially expressed protein results obtained using MS/MS data
- making a custom AnnotationDBI database, integrating and vizualizing enriched pathways from DEG and DEP using the Pathview package
